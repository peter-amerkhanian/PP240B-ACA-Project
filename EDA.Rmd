Loading the data
```{r}
library(haven)
aca_data_march_cps <- read_dta("Impact_ACA/aca_data_march_cps.dta")
```

Exploring the top
```{r}
knitr::kable(
  head(aca_data_march_cps), 
  caption = "First 5 rows:",
  padding = 0,

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
